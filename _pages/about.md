Émilie is a Data Specialist at the Archaeology Data Service at the University of York, a Research Fellow at the University of Oxford, and Co-Director at the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative. Her research interests encompass Mesopotamian social history, human-environment relationships, Sumerian philology, and Computational Linguistics of cuneiform languages.
  
Émilie employs both a traditional philological approach and computational methods in her work. Although her education is based in the Humanities, she has perfected her skills in data science, with a focus on data management and curation, natural language processing, and network analysis.
  
After a B.A. in Religious Studies specializing in Hinduism at the Université du Québec à Montréal, Émilie has pursued her interest in the Ancient World at the Université de Genève with Prof. Antoine Cavigneaux, where she prepared a Master's thesis on the fishing industry in the Early Dynastic IIIb period (2012). Her doctoral dissertation discusses social identity in the third millennium through a study of the pantheon of the ancient city of Adab.
